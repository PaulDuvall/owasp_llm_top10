# Detecting Prompt Injection in AI Apps: My Approach

According to OWASP, prompt injection is one of the top vulnerabilities affecting LLMs—models can be tricked into leaking info or doing things you didn’t intend. This isn’t just theory: I’ve run hands-on tests and seen real vulnerabilities.

A few takeaways:
- Prompt injection is real and testable. LLMs can be probed with crafted prompts to expose weaknesses.
- While I'm still experimenting, I tried open source tools, but hit practical issues—so I built my own tool. (Your mileage may vary.)
- The OWASP LLM Top 10 keeps me focused on real-world risks.

The tool automates detection, generates reports (Markdown, HTML, JSON), and makes it easy to review findings. Right now, the focus is prompt injection, but I plan to cover more LLM risks soon.

If you’re building with LLMs, try testing for prompt injection early. Security works best when you automatically build it into the AI lifecycle.
