"""
Attack Vectors Module - Defines various prompt injection attack techniques.

This module contains a collection of prompt injection attack vectors based on the
OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications. Each attack vector includes sample malicious prompts
and metadata about the attack technique.

User Story: US-102 - As a security tester, I need a comprehensive collection of prompt
injection techniques to test LLM vulnerabilities.
