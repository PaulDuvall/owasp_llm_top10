# ðŸš¨ How I Detect Prompt Injection in AI Apps (OWASP LLM Top 10)

If youâ€™re building with LLMs, you canâ€™t ignore prompt injection. Iâ€™ve seen firsthand how attackers can trick models into leaking sensitive info or doing things you never intended.

Hereâ€™s my approach:

- Prompt injection is real. Iâ€™ve tested LLMs that were wide open to attack.
- You can detect it. I use open source tools to probe for weaknessesâ€”before attackers do.
- The OWASP LLM Top 10 is my roadmap. It keeps my testing focused on real-world risks, not theory.

In my latest write-up, I show:
- Actual prompt injection examples
- How I automate detection in my workflow
- Steps to make AI security a habit, not an afterthought

Bottom line: If youâ€™re shipping AI, test for prompt injection. Donâ€™t wait for a breach to care about security.
